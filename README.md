[Concrete CMS](https://www.concretecms.com/) Nestable Manual Nav
===========================================================
"**Nestable Manual Nav**" provides a custom navigation menu for designers and developers that lets you manually choose, arrange and nest page links. The menu is outputted as a plain unordered list (&lt;ul&gt; and &lt;li&gt; tags) ready to be styled via your theme's CSS. Unlike the built-in auto-nav block, this menu lets you choose any pages, put them in any order, and change the link names.
