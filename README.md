[concrete5](https://www.concrete5.org) Nestable Manual Nav
===========================================================

Description
-----------
"**Nestable Manual Nav**" provides a custom navigation menu for designers and developers that lets you manually choose, arrange and nest page links. The menu is outputted as a plain unordered list (&lt;ul&gt; and &lt;li&gt; tags) ready to be styled via your theme's CSS. Unlike the built-in auto-nav block, this menu lets you choose any pages, put them in any order, and change the link names.
